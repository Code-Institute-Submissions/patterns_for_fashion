# Patterns For Fashion
The live website can be viewed [here](https://patterns-for-fashion.herokuapp.com/)

![Mock-up](static/mockup.png)

The purpose of creating this website is building an e-commerce store using Django, Postgres and Stripe payments. Users can purchase products after authenticating.

The marketed products consist of carefully tailored clothes made of high quality materials.

The purpose of the site's management is selling high quality garments which don't go out of fashion easily and achieve longer technical lifetime.

Fast fashion is a very toxic lifestyle for the environment and people must be encouraged to buy less and smarter.

Because people come in a lot of different sizes and proportions, the owners of the site have decided to create in the near future the possibility
for the users to order garments on custom sizes.

1. On the Resources button select a new Postgres database.
    -   ![Postgres](static/deployment/postgres.png)
1. Back in your GitPod install dj_database_url, and psycopg2 by typing the following commands:

    ```
    $ pip3 install dj_database_url
    ```

    ```
    $ pip3 install psycopg2-binary
    ```

1. Freeze the requirements

    ```
    $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

1. In projects' settings.py file import dj_database_url and make sure you don't forget to run migrations for the new database.
1. Create superuser

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

1. In settings.py you need an if statement so that when your app is running on Heroku
    where the database URL environment variable should be defined.
    -   ![Database if statement](static/deployment/database.png)
1. Then you need to instal gunicorn

    ```
    $ pip3 install gunicorn
    ```

    ```
    $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

1. Create your Procfile to tell Heroku to create a web dyno.
    -   ![gunicorn](static/deployment/gunicorn.png)
1. Temporarily disable collectstatic So that Heroku won't try to collect static files when YOU deploy.

    ```
    $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app your-app-name
    ```

1. In settings.py add to allowed hosts the hostname of your Heroku app and local host as well.
    -   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-herokuaap-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
1. Commit all your changes and push to github

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your commit name" 
    $ git push
    ```

1. Before deploying to Heroku you may need to initialize your Heroku git remote if you created your app on the website rather than with the CLI

    ```
    $ heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
    ```

1. Deploy to Heroku

    ```
    $ git push heroku master
    ```

1. Set to automatically deploy to Heroku when you push to github.
    -   On the Deploy tab set it to connect to GitHub.
    -   Search for your repository
    -   Click connect
    -   Enable automatic deploys
1. Add your config vars
    -   SECRET_KEY ('YOUR_SECRET_KEY')
    -   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY ('YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY')
    -   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY ('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
    -   STRIPE_WH_SECRET ('YOUR_STRIPE_WH_SECRET')
1. Set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.
    -   DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ

## AWS account setup
1. You need to create a AWS account. You need toenter a credit card number which will be used for billing
    if you go above the free usage limits. You should thoroughly research and understand the costs.
1. After signing in your account, in the Service tab search for the s3 and create a new bucket and name it to match your Heroku app.
1. Select the region closest to you.
1. Unblok public access and click create bucket.
1. More on setting up the static files and images with AWS on this [tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html)
